# Terminal Basics

## Goal
By the end of this lesson, you‚Äôll be able to open a terminal, move between folders, list files, and use handy shortcuts to work faster.

Live Preview
There‚Äôs no live preview for the terminal, but try each step in your own terminal as you go!

Step-by-Step Task Instructions
1. Open the Terminal
On most systems:

Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type Terminal, hit Enter.

Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd or powershell, hit Enter.

Linux: Press Ctrl + Alt + T or find ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù in your applications menu.

<aside class="tip"> <strong>Tip:</strong> You can pin your terminal app to your taskbar or dock for quick access. </aside>
2. Where Am I?
Use pwd to print your current working directory.

bash
Copy
Edit
pwd
Expected Output (Mac/Linux):

bash
Copy
Edit
/Users/yourname
Expected Output (Windows):

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\yourname
<aside class="why"> <strong>Why this works:</strong> `pwd` stands for "print working directory"‚Äîit tells you where you are in the file system. </aside>
3. List Files and Folders
Use ls (or dir on Windows) to see what‚Äôs in your current folder.

bash
Copy
Edit
ls
Expected Output:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures
<aside class="tip"> <strong>Windows users:</strong> Use `dir` instead of `ls` for now. </aside>
4. Change Directory
Use cd followed by a folder name to move into it:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Documents
Then use pwd again to confirm where you are.

bash
Copy
Edit
pwd
Expected Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
/Users/yourname/Documents
5. Go Up One Folder
Use cd .. to move back to the parent directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ..
Then check your location again:

bash
Copy
Edit
pwd
6. Make a Folder
Create a new folder with mkdir:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir my-first-folder
Then check it‚Äôs there:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls
7. Go Into the New Folder
bash
Copy
Edit
cd my-first-folder
You‚Äôre now inside your new folder!

8. Handy Terminal Shortcuts
These shortcuts will save you time as you use the terminal more:

Shortcut	What It Does
‚Üë (Up Arrow)	Scroll through previous commands
‚Üì (Down Arrow)	Scroll forward through command history
Ctrl + C	Cancel the current command
Tab	Autocomplete a file or folder name
Ctrl + L	Clear the terminal screen (like clear)
!!	Re-run the last command

<aside class="tip"> <strong>Tip:</strong> Try pressing `Up Arrow` a few times to see your command history. Then press `Enter` to run one again. </aside> <aside class="warning"> <strong>Warning:</strong> `Ctrl + C` is your emergency stop button. Use it if a command freezes or runs too long. </aside>
Practice Challenge
üéØ Try This:

Go back to your home directory.

Create a folder called practice-terminal.

Inside it, create another folder called subfolder.

Navigate into subfolder and use pwd to verify your path.

Try using the Up Arrow to repeat the mkdir and cd commands.

Use Ctrl + L to clear your screen.

Wrap-Up
You‚Äôve learned how to:

Open the terminal

Find out where you are with pwd

List files using ls or dir

Move between folders with cd

Create folders with mkdir

Use shortcuts like Up Arrow, Tab, and Ctrl + C
